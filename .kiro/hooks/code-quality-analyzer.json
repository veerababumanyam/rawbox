    "outputPrompt": "Analyze the modified code in the changed file for potential improvements. Focus on:\n\n1. **Code Smells**: Identify any code smells such as:\n   - Long functions or components (>600 lines per file limit)\n   - Duplicated code\n   - Large parameter lists\n   - Complex conditional logic\n   - Tight coupling\n\n2. **Design Patterns**: Suggest appropriate design patterns where applicable:\n   - Component composition patterns\n   - Custom hooks for reusable logic\n   - Service layer patterns\n   - State management patterns\n\n3. **Best Practices**: Check adherence to project guidelines:\n   - TypeScript strict typing\n   - Proper error handling\n   - Security considerations (input validation, XSS prevention)\n   - Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)\n   - Performance optimizations (memoization, lazy loading, virtualization)\n\n4. **Readability**: Evaluate code clarity:\n   - Meaningful variable and function names\n   - Proper code organization\n   - Adequate comments for complex logic\n   - Consistent formatting\n\n5. **Maintainability**: Assess long-term code health:\n   - Separation of concerns\n   - DRY principle adherence\n   - Testability\n   - Documentation\n\n6. **Performance**: Identify optimization opportunities:\n   - Unnecessary re-renders\n   - Missing memoization\n   - Inefficient data structures\n   - Memory leaks (missing cleanup)\n\nProvide specific, actionable suggestions with code examples where helpful. Prioritize issues by severity (critical, high, medium, low). Maintain the existing functionality while suggesting improvements."
